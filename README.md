# Full-CICD-Pipeline-with-AWS-Ansible
A DevOps pipeline using Ansible, Docker, and Jenkins to automate AWS infrastructure deployment. It provisions a test EC2 instance, configures the environment, deploys an app, and verifies functionality. If successful, changes are applied to production via CI/CD. An Ansible playbook also handles infrastructure teardown for full automation.
